# Survivor Draft

A web application written in Django for visualizing & interacting with survivor drafts.

Organized by season, each season has a set of teams with a team owner & name. Each team has a set of survivors as drafted by that team owner. Each survivor has data associated with them pertaining to their performance on that season of survivor.

Survivor data includes overall placement, number of immunities won, idols found, confessions featured in, fan favorite winner.

Future plans include graph visualization, historical data, user accounts, comments, DB administrative capabilities (modifying stuff thru the UI instead of thru an external DB tool), & more.

Now with a proper domain, draft your survivors at https://outdraft.me
